          I have good leadership qualities and am confident of myself. I’m able to keep a calm and level head whenever I am in situations of stress. I am a learner and always want to be improving or learning more about things. I would like to consider myself someone who can relate to anyone and any culture and background. It allows me to make very personal connections with everyone I meet.
      </p>
      <p>
          I’m a hard working person who doesn’t like to give up. I strive for what I want and keep my goals in mind 24/7. This allows me to see exactly what I want and plan on how I will get it.
      </p>
      <p>
          I think positively and can execute on difficult tasks. I’m not an individual who needs to be micromanaged. Rather, when given a specific task, I can figure out the best ways to solve the problem in an autonomous manner.
